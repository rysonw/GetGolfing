# ⛳ GetGolfing

**GetGolfing** is a minimal Android app built with **Jetpack Compose**. Click the button to see if golfing right now is actually a feasible option.
The main screen asks the question — *“Should I Golf Today?”* — and presents a button for checking conditions. Will check for inclement weather and do a search for any openings for a single at nearby courses.
